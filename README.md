##Android market chat bot

### Goal
To build a chat bot that listens on the dev chat room, and brings in any reviews as soon as they are posted on the Android Market (for the app that the dev team in building). To enable move the feedback cycle closer, and let dev team learn how the app is being used by the real people.

Could be used to collect feedback from beta testers!

### Future

Clean up, and make a nice API for building chat bots.
Plug-able functions for new tool support, say mingle.
