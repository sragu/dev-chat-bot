##Choosing a Jabber Server for experimentation?

    using ejabberd for jabber.
    openfire is a mess, requires sudo access - not easy to uninstall.
    needs to go through web browser to manage accounts.
    ejabberd is installable through brew - win
    ejabberdctl to add users.
    ejabberd lacks documentation - same as openfire.
